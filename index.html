            <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello there! I'm Fernando, I hope you're having a fun time looking over my Portfolio. I was born in Brazil and lived here for most of my life where I was able to learn and live with amazing people.
            During my teenage years I was able to move to Canada for a short time where I was able to learn a different culture and get in love with technology and programming.
            I am not perfect and will never be. but I am always looking for ways to improve myself and help others.
            </p>
